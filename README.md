# Voting-machine-in-Verilog
The given project counts the votes accumulated by 4 candidatses and displays them on leds. The votes are logged only if the buttons are pressed for a sufficient time and to check this a counter is initialized. The votelogger module computes the total votes received by each candidate. The modecontrol module controls the leds according to the mode set. If the mode is 0 , then all the leds glow while the button is pressed. If the mode is set to 1, the leds display the numberr of votes received by a particular candidate.
